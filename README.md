# Hangman-Game-Redo
Week 3 HW

<!-- Refactor this bottom section to have rules/instructions on how to play this game. -->


<!-- // Have player press a key to start the game.
// Randomly choose from an array of movies to have the player guess.
// Need to split the characters of the movie title so the player can guess each letter.
// Have intial amount of guesses - 10.
// If player types a correct letter, guesses remaining stay the same.
// Way to generate dashes for each letter is to have span for each letter in html that gets auto generated based on how many characters the movie name has. Once letter gets typed, replace the dash with the letter.
// If incorrect letter gets typed, decrement guesses remaining by one. Insert letter into letters guessed div element.

// **** Need to figure out way to check when letter was guessed already so as to not penalize player for guessing same letter and letting them lose a guess. Create if statement to see if letter is currently used in incorrectly guessed array or in the current word.

//If player doesn't guess the word with all their guesses, create some sort of notification that says they lost and reset the game for them.

// If player does win, increment wins column and reset the game.

// BONUSES
// =======
// Play movie trailer when user wins. -->
